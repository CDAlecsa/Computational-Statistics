# Monte Carlo methods for approximating functions and basic Metropolis algorithm

This a data repository concerning a Python based implementation (created in Spyder) for Metropolis algorithm and Monte Carlo methods.

'MonteCarlo.py' file :
- A simple example is given in order to approximate PI with given uniformly generated numbers.
- We used the 'lambda' procedure in order to define a function. One can replace this function by a more complicated one.

'Metropolis.py' file :
- The classical Metropolis algorithm is defined as a function and used in order to approximate the exact distribution (I have called it 'Estimated distribution')
